### **Time + Attention = Learning**

  

In a world full of distractions, MindOwl rewards what really matters: **being present**.

  

You’re already spending time listening — to podcasts, courses, YouTube videos, training audios.

Why not make that time smarter, sharper, and 10x more memorable?

  

MindOwl turns your listening moments into mini learning battles — solo or with friends — by **listening through your phone's mic** and **quizzing you in real time**.

⚡ One brain. One audio. One shot to answer before the next question drops.

### **How It Works**

1. **Hit play** on any content — MindOwl listens passively through the mic.
    
2. Every few seconds, it transcribes what it hears and **asks a smart, AI-generated question**.
    
3. You **buzz in** with the answer — the faster, the better.
    
4. If you’re with others, you all hear the same thing… but only one gets the top score.
    
5. After each session, review your performance, replay key parts, and level up.
